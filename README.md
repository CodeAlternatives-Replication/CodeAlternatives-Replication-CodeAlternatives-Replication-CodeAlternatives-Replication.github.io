# Replication Package for REALAU

We conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the accuracy, usefulness, and quality of REALAU by answering the following research questions.
- **RQ1 (Accuracy for API Usage Prediction):** How accurately REALAU can predict the masked API usages in code?
- **RQ2 (Usefulness for Code Customization):** Are the code alternatives recommended by REALAU useful for code customization tasks?
- **RQ3 (Quality of Recommended Alternatives):** What is the quality of the code alternatives recommended by REALAU?

In the above three research questions, RQ2 and RQ3 involve 6 code customization tasks.
We list the tasks and explain how the questions in the tasks are collect.
